# Data Isolation and Audit Trail Fix

## Problem
The current system had two major issues:

1. **Data Isolation**: Staff members could see data from other users, not just their own
2. **Audit Trail**: The audit trail wasn't showing activity for other users, making it difficult for admins to monitor system activity

## Root Cause
The RLS (Row Level Security) policies were too permissive and didn't properly isolate data by user. Staff could see data they didn't create, and the audit trail policies weren't properly configured.

## Solution

### 1. Data Isolation Fix
Updated all RLS policies to ensure proper data isolation:

#### For Staff Users:
- ✅ **Can only see data they created themselves**
- ✅ **Can only see clubs they registered**
- ✅ **Can only see farmers they registered**
- ✅ **Can only see loans they created**
- ✅ **Can only see field visits they created**
- ✅ **Can only see deliveries they created**
- ✅ **Can only see input distributions they created**
- ✅ **Can only see equipment issuance they created**
- ✅ **Can only see repayments they created**

#### For Admin Users:
- ✅ **Can see all data across all users**
- ✅ **Can see all audit logs**
- ✅ **Can manage all records**

### 2. Audit Trail Fix
Updated audit trail policies to ensure proper visibility:

#### For Staff Users:
- ✅ **Can only see their own audit logs**
- ✅ **Can track their own activities**

#### For Admin Users:
- ✅ **Can see all audit logs from all users**
- ✅ **Can monitor all system activities**

## Key Changes Made

### Database Policies Updated:
```sql
-- Staff can only see data they created
CREATE POLICY "Farmers - staff select assigned" ON public.farmers
  FOR SELECT USING (
    public.get_user_role(auth.uid()) = 'admin' OR 
    created_by = auth.uid() -- Staff can only see farmers they registered
  );

-- Admins can see all audit logs, staff see their own
CREATE POLICY "Audit logs - admin view all" ON public.audit_logs
  FOR SELECT USING (public.get_user_role(auth.uid()) = 'admin');

CREATE POLICY "Audit logs - staff view own" ON public.audit_logs
  FOR SELECT USING (
    public.get_user_role(auth.uid()) IS NOT NULL AND 
    user_id = auth.uid() -- Staff can only see their own audit logs
  );
```

### Frontend Updates:
- Updated audit trail page to rely on RLS policies for data filtering
- Added comments explaining the data isolation behavior

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Database Fix
**Copy the contents of `fix_data_isolation_and_audit.sql` and run it in your Supabase SQL Editor.**

This will:
- Update all RLS policies for proper data isolation
- Fix audit trail visibility for different user roles
- Create helper functions for data access control

### Step 2: Frontend Fix is Already Applied
The updated `audit-trail.tsx` file now properly handles data isolation through RLS policies.

## What This Fixes

### Data Isolation:
- ✅ Staff users will only see data they created
- ✅ Staff users will only see clubs they registered
- ✅ Staff users will only see farmers they registered
- ✅ Admin users can see all data across all users
- ✅ Proper data isolation like any other modern application

### Audit Trail:
- ✅ Admin users can see all audit logs from all users
- ✅ Staff users can only see their own audit logs
- ✅ Proper activity tracking and monitoring
- ✅ Admins can oversee all system activities

## Testing

### For Staff Users:
1. Login as a staff user
2. Verify you only see clubs you registered
3. Verify you only see farmers you registered
4. Verify you only see your own audit logs
5. Verify you cannot see data from other users

### For Admin Users:
1. Login as an admin user
2. Verify you can see all clubs from all users
3. Verify you can see all farmers from all users
4. Verify you can see all audit logs from all users
5. Verify you can monitor all system activities

## Security Benefits

### Data Privacy:
- Staff data is properly isolated
- No cross-user data leakage
- Each user only sees their own work

### Audit Compliance:
- Complete audit trail for admins
- Individual activity tracking for staff
- Proper system monitoring capabilities

### Access Control:
- Role-based data access
- Proper permission enforcement
- Secure data isolation

## Files Modified
- `fix_data_isolation_and_audit.sql` - Main database fix
- `src/pages/audit-trail.tsx` - Frontend audit trail updates

## Notes
- This fix maintains security while ensuring proper data isolation
- Staff users can work independently without seeing other users' data
- Admin users retain full oversight and monitoring capabilities
- All existing functionality remains intact with proper access controls
