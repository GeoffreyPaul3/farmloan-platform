# Shared Data Access System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a **shared data access system** where all users can view all data, create new data, but only admins can edit existing data. This ensures data transparency and collaboration while maintaining data integrity.

## Key Features

### 1. **Universal Data Visibility**
- ✅ All authenticated users can view ALL data across the platform
- ✅ No restrictions based on club assignments or user roles for viewing
- ✅ Complete transparency across all users

### 2. **Universal Data Creation**
- ✅ All authenticated users can create new data (clubs, farmers, loans, deliveries, etc.)
- ✅ Users can post data to clubs created by other users
- ✅ No restrictions on which clubs users can add data to

### 3. **Admin-Only Editing**
- ✅ Only users with `admin` role can edit existing data
- ✅ Staff users can create but cannot edit
- ✅ Maintains data integrity and prevents unauthorized changes

### 4. **Data Ownership Tracking**
- ✅ Every record tracks who created it (`created_by` field)
- ✅ Visual indicators show "You created this" vs "Created by [Name]"
- ✅ Users can easily identify their own data vs others' data

## Database Changes

### Migration: `20250825000000_implement_shared_data_access.sql`

#### 1. **Added Missing `created_by` Fields**
```sql
-- Ensures all tables have created_by tracking
ALTER TABLE public.deliveries ADD COLUMN created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE public.input_distributions ADD COLUMN created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE public.cash_payments ADD COLUMN created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE public.field_visits ADD COLUMN created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id);
```

#### 2. **New RLS Policies**
All tables now have these policies:

**View Policy (All Users)**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Table - all users can view" ON public.table_name
FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

**Create Policy (All Users)**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Table - all users can create" ON public.table_name
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```

**Edit Policy (Admin Only)**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Table - only admins can edit" ON public.table_name
FOR UPDATE USING (public.is_admin(auth.uid()))
WITH CHECK (public.is_admin(auth.uid()));
```

**Delete Policy (Admin Only)**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Table - only admins can delete" ON public.table_name
FOR DELETE USING (public.is_admin(auth.uid()));
```

#### 3. **Helper Functions**
```sql
-- Check if user is admin
CREATE FUNCTION public.is_admin(user_id UUID DEFAULT auth.uid())
RETURNS BOOLEAN;

-- Get data ownership information
CREATE FUNCTION public.get_data_ownership_info(table_name TEXT, record_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE(created_by UUID, created_by_name TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ, is_own_data BOOLEAN);
```

#### 4. **Data Ownership View**
```sql
CREATE VIEW public.data_ownership_view AS
-- Shows ownership information for all records across the system
```

## Frontend Components

### 1. **Data Ownership Badge Component**
**File:** `src/components/ui/data-ownership-badge.tsx`

```tsx
<DataOwnershipBadge
  createdBy={ownershipInfo.createdBy}
  createdByName={ownershipInfo.createdByName}
  createdAt={ownershipInfo.createdAt}
  isOwnData={ownershipInfo.isOwnData}
  showDetails={false}
/>
```

**Features:**
- Green badge: "You created this" (for user's own data)
- Blue badge: "Created by [Name]" (for others' data)
- Optional date display
- Clean, intuitive visual design

### 2. **Data Ownership Hook**
**File:** `src/hooks/use-data-ownership.ts`

```tsx
const { ownershipInfo, isLoading } = useDataOwnership('farmer_groups', club.id);
const canEdit = useCanEdit('farmer_groups', club.id);
const isOwnData = useIsOwnData('farmer_groups', club.id);
```

**Features:**
- Easy-to-use React hooks
- Automatic permission checking
- Cached queries for performance
- TypeScript support

## Implementation Examples

### 1. **Clubs Page Integration**
**File:** `src/pages/clubs.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<TableRow>
  <TableCell>Club Name</TableCell>
  <TableCell>Type</TableCell>
  <TableCell>Actions</TableCell>
</TableRow>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<TableRow>
  <TableCell>Club Name</TableCell>
  <TableCell>Type</TableCell>
  <TableCell>Created By</TableCell> {/* New column */}
  <TableCell>
    {/* Edit button only shows for admins */}
    {ownershipInfo?.canEdit && <EditButton />}
  </TableCell>
</TableRow>
```

### 2. **Data Ownership Display**
```tsx
{ownershipInfo && (
  <DataOwnershipBadge
    createdBy={ownershipInfo.createdBy}
    createdByName={ownershipInfo.createdByName}
    createdAt={ownershipInfo.createdAt}
    isOwnData={ownershipInfo.isOwnData}
    showDetails={false}
  />
)}
```

## User Experience

### For Regular Staff Users:
1. **Can view all data** - See everything across the platform
2. **Can create new data** - Add clubs, farmers, loans, deliveries, etc.
3. **Can post to any club** - No restrictions on which clubs they can add data to
4. **Cannot edit existing data** - Edit buttons are hidden
5. **See ownership clearly** - Green badges for their data, blue for others

### For Admin Users:
1. **All staff permissions** - Can view and create everything
2. **Can edit any data** - Edit buttons are visible and functional
3. **Can delete data** - Full administrative control
4. **See ownership clearly** - Same visual indicators as staff

## Benefits

### 1. **Data Transparency**
- Everyone can see all data
- No hidden information
- Complete visibility across the organization

### 2. **Collaboration**
- Users can work with data from any club
- No artificial barriers between teams
- Shared knowledge and insights

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- Only admins can modify existing data
- Prevents accidental or unauthorized changes
- Maintains data quality

### 4. **Clear Ownership**
- Users know what they created vs what others created
- Accountability and transparency
- Easy to track data lineage

### 5. **Flexibility**
- Users can post data to any club
- No restrictions on cross-club operations
- Supports real-world workflow needs

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- All policies are enforced at the database level
- No client-side security bypass possible
- Consistent enforcement across all access methods

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control**
- Admin role required for editing
- Staff role for viewing and creating
- Clear separation of permissions

### 3. **Audit Trail**
- All changes are logged in `audit_logs` table
- Complete history of who did what when
- Compliance and accountability

## Migration Instructions

1. **Run the migration:**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Update frontend components** (already done in this implementation)

3. **Test the system:**
   - Create data as different users
   - Verify ownership badges display correctly
   - Confirm edit permissions work as expected

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Advanced Filtering**
- Filter by "My Data" vs "Others' Data"
- Date range filtering
- User-specific filtering

### 2. **Notifications**
- Notify users when their data is modified by admins
- Activity feed showing recent changes

### 3. **Data Export**
- Export data with ownership information
- Filtered exports based on ownership

### 4. **Analytics Dashboard**
- Show data creation statistics by user
- Track collaboration patterns
- Performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Check if user has proper role (admin/staff)
   - Verify RLS policies are applied correctly

2. **Ownership badges not showing**
   - Ensure `created_by` fields are populated
   - Check if the database function exists

3. **Edit buttons not appearing**
   - Verify user has admin role
   - Check `canEdit` permission logic

### Debug Commands:
```sql
-- Check user role
SELECT get_user_role(auth.uid());

-- Check if user is admin
SELECT public.is_admin(auth.uid());

-- Get ownership info for a record
SELECT * FROM public.get_data_ownership_info('farmer_groups', 'record-id-here');
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly shared data access system that promotes collaboration while maintaining data integrity. Users can work freely across the platform while having clear visibility into data ownership and appropriate access controls.
